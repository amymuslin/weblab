                <p>Hi, my name is Amy and this is my horse, Eileen. Eileen is a Hanoverian mare from Germany. She is ten years old and I have owned her for about a year and a half now. In that time, we have become very close and a very good team. I love her with all my heart and she is part of the family. Her favorite food is bananas and sometimes she bites me. I'm pretty sure its out of love though.Â </p>
